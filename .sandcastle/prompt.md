## Environment / resources available

These external resources are already provisioned in this sandbox — use them; do not
treat the issues that need them as blocked.

- **Supabase (issue #2 and dependents)** — config is in the environment:
  - `SUPABASE_URL` — project REST/Auth base URL.
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` / `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — the public (anon) key.
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` / `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` — the service-role (secret) key; server/generator only, never ship to the browser.
  - `DATABASE_URL` — a session-pooler Postgres URI (port 5432) that supports DDL. Apply schema/migrations with this (e.g. `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f schema.sql`); `psql` is installed.
  - Note: keys are Supabase's new-format `sb_publishable_`/`sb_secret_` keys, valid as drop-in for anon/service_role with a recent `@supabase/supabase-js`. Read config from env; never commit secrets.
- **StackRabbit engine (issue #4 and the generator chain)** — already running locally:
  - Reachable at `STACKRABBIT_URL` (`http://127.0.0.1:3000`). Health: `GET /ping`.
  - Move endpoints take query-string args (`board`, `currentPiece`, `nextPiece`, `level`, `lines`, `inputFrameTimeline`, …); e.g. `GET /get-move-cpp?...`, `GET /rate-move-cpp?...`.
  - Per CLAUDE.md, the engine is **offline/generator-only** — wrap it behind the typed client in `src/generator`; never call it from the play app.
- **BetaTetris cross-check engine (issue #54)** — now baked into the image (offline, CPU):
  - A userspace micromamba env `bt` (python 3.12 + pytorch-cpu) + the built `tetris` C++ extension + the v1.0.0 perfect/normal weights. Run scripts inside it with the `bt-run` wrapper, e.g. `bt-run python betatetris-spike/pull.py && bt-run python betatetris-spike/compare.py`.
  - Paths are in the env: `BT_HOME`, `BT_REPO_PY`, `BT_MODELS`, `BT_OUT`. Method/verdict: `FINDINGS-betatetris-spike.md`; harness + paths table: `betatetris-spike/README.md`.
  - Same guardrail as StackRabbit: **offline / generator-only** (and GPLv3 — never link it into or ship it with the play app).

## Run scope (this run)

This is the **2026-06-21 consensus-bank batch** — four issues (#51–#54) from a `/grill-with-docs` design session that followed the BetaTetris cross-check spike. They move the bank toward *quality-graded rating + difficulty-by-tightness + a deeper-confirmed optimal + a BetaTetris-blessed consensus filter*. Rationale: `docs/decisions.md` (2026-06-21 — Consensus bank) + `FINDINGS-betatetris-spike.md`. All prior batches (#1–#50) are **closed**.

- **Issues (this batch — work top-to-bottom):**
  - **#51** `[play]` — graded reward curve: replace the binary `solved?0:1` Glicko outcome with a quality-graded `scoreToOutcome(score)` (95 = neutral, convex up to 100, steep-below to a 0.10 floor) in `packages/rating` (live + offline `tally.ts`); persist a numeric `attempts.score` (additive migration); the play UI shows graded credit. Detail in the issue body.
  - **#52** `[generator]` — enforce difficulty bands by measured `acceptCount` (hard = ≤ ~2 acceptable answers); generation deliberately spans easy→hard. Reshapes the bank → **regen**.
  - **#53** `[generator]` — deeper-StackRabbit best-confirm gate (`playoutCount>0`) that re-ranks/rejects eval-only-quirk optimals. Reshapes the bank → **regen**.
  - **#54** `[generator]` — BetaTetris true-consensus filter. The offline BetaTetris build is **now provisioned in this sandbox** (baked into the image; see the resources section above), so this is **in scope** for autonomous work. **Do #54 last**, after #51–#53 close — it depends on the deeper-confirmed optimal (#53) and the difficulty bands (#52). **Phase 1 first: measure the keep-rate** (reuse `betatetris-spike/{pull,compare}.py` via `bt-run`) and post the number on the issue; only build the Phase-2 generation gate if the keep-rate is workable (a smaller, more tactical bank is acceptable). If the BetaTetris env smoke-check failed at sandbox start, leave a blocker comment and move on rather than thrashing.
- **Bank regen — #52 AND #53 reshape which candidates survive + `combos`/difficulty.** **Back up first** (`create table if not exists puzzles_bak_<date> as select * from puzzles`). Regen is additive in form — `boardKey`s and placements are unchanged; only which candidates survive + their scores/difficulty change. If both run in one launch, the later regen incorporates both. The live bank is currently **309**. **Do NOT drop any `*_bak_*` or `*_quarantine_*` table.**
- **#51's migration is additive** — `alter table public.attempts add column if not exists score double precision`; re-running `schema.sql` stays safe.
- **Engine stays OFFLINE / generator-only** (StackRabbit at `$STACKRABBIT_URL`); never call it from the play app. Supabase **anonymous sign-ins are ENABLED** (not a blocker).
- **Do NOT deploy, push, or host.** The push + GitHub Pages redeploy stay a manual step after this run.
- When **#51–#54** are all closed (or you are blocked on the remaining one and have left a comment), output the completion signal.

# Task

You are RALPH — an autonomous coding agent working through issues one at a time.

## Priority order

Work on issues in this order:

1. **Bug fixes** — broken behaviour affecting users
2. **Tracer bullets** — thin end-to-end slices that prove an approach works
3. **Polish** — improving existing functionality (error messages, UX, docs)
4. **Refactors** — internal cleanups with no user-visible change

Pick the highest-priority open issue that is not blocked by another open issue.

## Workflow

1. **Explore** — read the issue carefully. Pull in the parent PRD if referenced. Read the relevant source files and tests before writing any code.
2. **Plan** — decide what to change and why. Keep the change as small as possible.
3. **Execute** — use RGR (Red → Green → Repeat → Refactor): write a failing test first, then write the implementation to pass it.
4. **Verify** — run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` before committing. Fix any failures before proceeding.
5. **Commit** — make a single git commit. The message MUST:
   - Start with `RALPH:` prefix
   - Include the task completed and any PRD reference
   - List key decisions made
   - List files changed
   - Note any blockers for the next iteration
6. **Close** — close the issue with `gh issue close <ID> --comment "Completed by Sandcastle"` explaining what was done.

## Rules

- Work on **one issue per iteration**. Do not attempt multiple issues in a single iteration.
- Do not close an issue until you have committed the fix and verified tests pass.
- Do not leave commented-out code or TODO comments in committed code.
- If you are blocked (missing context, failing tests you cannot fix, external dependency), leave a comment on the issue and move on — do not close it.

# Done

When all actionable issues are complete (or you are blocked on all remaining ones), or the open-issues block at the top of this prompt is empty, output the completion signal:

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
